  "description": "<p>Brazilian guitarist and singer based in the Netherlands.</p><p>My music is built on <strong>faith</strong>, <strong>struggle</strong>, and <strong>real life</strong>. Every song reflects what I believe, what I fight, and what I feel. I move through <strong>Heavy</strong>, <strong>Thrash</strong>, <strong>Progressive</strong> and <strong>Death Metal</strong>, following whatever sound carries the message best.</p><p>I've been writing songs since I was a kid, always turning <strong>thoughts</strong> and <strong>emotions</strong> into riffs and words. The <strong>guitar</strong> is my foundation, and my <strong>voice</strong> is how I speak truth through the noise.</p><p>I believe <strong>Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the Life</strong> — and my music stands on that ground, even when it walks through <strong>dark places</strong>.</p><p>My first release was <strong>Abismo</strong>, with my former band Of Christ (2021–2022). In 2024, I released the single <strong>Hail to the King</strong> during the Christmas season. My next release, <strong>Night Divine</strong>, arrives this Christmas in 2025. After that, I'll turn my focus away from holiday music and dive deeper into songs about <strong>everyday life</strong> and the <strong>battles within it</strong>.</p><p>I'm <strong>G.A. Oliver</strong></p>",
