  "description": "<p>Born in Brazil and living in the Netherlands, I've been writing my songs since my childhood. Always about my <strong>thoughts</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong>, and about my <strong>faith</strong> and&nbsp;the <strong>dark</strong> moments of life.</p><p>Guitar is my&nbsp;musical passion, and my voice is how I scream about what I feel and what I believe.&nbsp;I write about love, pain and the ups and downs of life. Always following my understanding that Jesus is the&nbsp;Way, the Truth and the Life. I also write praises for the One who deserves it all.</p><p>My first released work was <strong>Abismo</strong>, together with my former band Of Christ (right after I left it), in which I sang from 2021 to 2022. In 2024, I released the single <strong>Hail to the King</strong> for Christmas, and my most recent release is the EP <strong>Night Divine</strong>, also for Christmas. That's probably my last holiday work for a while, as I want to start working&nbsp;again on songs about life during the rest of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>I am G.A. Oliver.</p>",
